### Introduction

As an avid basketball fan, specifically the National Basketball Association (NBA), I often find myself plopped in front of a TV paying close attention to the details of the game. There are a lot of things that catch my eye, but one, in particular, is the box score, also known as the stat sheet. A major component of the stat sheet is a team's shooting percentage (field goal %). A team or player's field goal percentage (FG%) can be measured by taking the number of shots made divided by the total number of shots. Again, this can be measured for a team, or a specific player. 

Generally, you would be inclined to think that the team with the higher FG% should win the game. And in most games, I would argue that is the case. However, other factors would play into the outcome of the game besides how well a team shoots from the field (i.e. free throws, turnovers, etc.) But I won't bore you with those details right now...

But what we do know is that FG% is a MAJOR factor. After all, the goal is to score more points than the other team, and FG% is a direct measure of scoring. And as I watch these NBA games, I become curious. Throughout a season, what factors, if any at all, significantly affect the shooting percentage of players?

- Would players competing on their home court shoot a higher percentage than those competing on the road?
- Does the type of shot alter the shooting percentage?
- Is there a particular month that players make shots at a higher rate?

Below I will investigate these questions and more. Stay with me, because I think you will find the results interesting!

### Data

I worked with a dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs). The dataset contains every shot taken during the 2014-2015 NBA season, except for games played after March 4th, 2015. 

### Hypothesis

Given a set of 2 circumstances, I hypothesized which circumstance would yield a higher FG %:

1) Shot Type: 2-pointers vs. 3 pointers
  - Hypothesis: Players make a higher percentage of their shots on 2-point attempts
  - Explanation: This one seemed to be the most straightforward. I thought that the closer players were to the basket, the better chance     they had at making the shot
  
2) Location: Home vs. Away
  - Hypothesis: Players make a higher percentage of their shots during home games
  - Explanation: I think players tend to feel more comfortable at home games. The majority of the crowd is rooting for them, they didn't have to travel far for the game, and their routine isn't messed up from traveling. I thought this would lead to better a better shooting percentage at home.
  
3) Regulation vs. Overtime (OT)
  - Hypothesis: Players make a higher percentage of their shots during regulation
  - Explanation: Players are more tired during OT periods because they have been playing awhile already. Their bodies wear down and shooting becomes harder.
  
4) Shot Clock: Varying Times
  - Hypothesis: Players make a higher percentage of their as the shot clock winds down
  - Explanation: This was tough for me. At first, I thought the earlier the better, but then I thought players would be rushing shots early on. I thought that once plays are run and the ball is moved around a lot, it would lead to more open or better shots.
  
5) By Month
  - Hypothesis: Players make the highest percentage of their shots in the first month of the season
  - Explanation: This is when players are the freshest. Their bodies haven't worn down yet. Defenses don't know how to best guard certain players.
  
### Results/Visualizations (Hypotheses 1-4)
  
Here you can see the results from the first four testings. I will explain my findings below.

  ![Shooting_Percentage_Graphs](/img/Shooting_Percentage_Viz.png)
  
In each graph, I plotted an 'overall' field goal percentage. This is just the field goal percentage taking into account every observation (shot) in the dataset. Overall, players shot 45.2% from the field for the 2014-15 season. We'll call this the average FG%. 

In the top-left graph, we see that players shoot a higher percentage on 2-point shots.
  - Hypothesis 1 was **CORRECT**
  
In the top-right graph, we see that players shoot a higher percentage when they are at home.
  - Hypothesis 2 was **CORRECT**
 
In the bottom-left graph, we see that players shoot a higher percentage in regulation.
  - Hypothesis 3 was **CORRECT**
  
In the bottom-right, we see that players shoot the highest percentage within the first 4 seconds of the possession, and it the shooting percentage gradually declines after that.
  - Hypothesis 4 was **INCORRECT**
  
### Results/Visualizations (Hypothesis 5)

The line graph below shows the progression of shooting percentage throughout the 2014-15 NBA season.
